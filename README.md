## ðŸ§  **Personal Experiment: Harnessing Hyperfocus**

This project represents a personal journey and self-experiment on how I can leverage my ADHD tendenciesâ€”specifically *hyperfocus*â€”to achieve a major goal. The objective is to explore the productive potential of hyperfocus by using it effectively to showcase the benefits of deep work and strategic time management.

## ðŸš€ **The Goal**

The aim is to implement key features of a Marvelous Designer-like cloth simulation system. This involves exploring:
- **Cloth physics simulation**,
- **Collision detection**, 
- **Dynamic deformation**, 
- **Sewing simulation**, and more.

This hands-on project is both a technical challenge and an opportunity to discover personal productivity patterns that maximize focus and workflow clarity.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Matters**

Through this experiment, I intend to:
- Discover how structured sprints and focused sessions improve task execution.
- Learn strategies to mitigate distractions and channel hyperfocus into productive outcomes.
- Build a functional cloth simulation system that demonstrates applied 3D physics programming skills.

This journey is not just about codingâ€”itâ€™s about strategy, experimentation, and personal growth.
