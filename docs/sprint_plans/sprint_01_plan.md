# Sprint One: Foundation and Initial Exploration

---

## Objective:
Build the core foundation and environment necessary for implementing key Marvelous Designer-like simulation features. This sprint focuses on setting up the development environment, exploring the simulation concepts, and implementing the initial cloth simulation core logic.

---

## Tasks:

1. **Set Up the Development Environment**
   - Choose the programming language and 3D rendering library (OpenGL, Unity, Three.js, etc.).
   - Set up a clean repository.
   - Install dependencies and ensure build pipeline runs smoothly.
   
2. **Research and Understand Cloth Simulation Principles**
   - Study the physics behind Marvelous Designer's cloth simulation.
   - Identify core mathematical models:
     - Spring-based simulation.
     - Collision detection.
     - Mesh manipulation under physical constraints.
   - Document findings and create a reference plan for implementation.

3. **Implement a Basic Mesh Loader**
   - Load 3D mesh objects from file formats like OBJ, FBX, or STL.
   - Ensure compatibility with a standard cloth simulation pipeline.

4. **Model the Basic Physical Simulation**
   - Simulate simple cloth movements using vertex physics and constraints.
   - Set up a basic particle system that responds to gravity and collision.

5. **Prototype Collision Detection Logic**
   - Ensure particles (vertices of the cloth mesh) can detect collisions with static environment surfaces.

6. **Establish the Input System**
   - Allow manipulation of parameters like gravity, wind force, and input for altering cloth properties (stretch, damping, etc.).

## Milestones:

- **Milestone 1: Environment and Mesh Loader**
  - Development Environment is set up.
  - Mesh loading is successfully implemented.
  
- **Milestone 2: Basic Physical Simulation**
  - Simple vertex simulation in response to gravity and forces.

- **Milestone 3: Collision Detection Prototype**
  - The cloth should demonstrate proper collision with a defined plane or static object.

## Expected Outcome:

- A functional simulation environment with:
  - A loaded 3D mesh ready for simulation.
  - Initial physics simulation applied to simulate simple cloth-like behavior.
  - Preliminary collision detection between the cloth mesh and environment.

---

## Tools/Technologies:

- 3D rendering and simulation libraries (Unity, Three.js, OpenGL, or others).
- Physics engine models (spring-based simulation or vertex deformation techniques).
- Mesh import utilities (OBJ/FBX parsing support).
